                This project aims at exploring global fertility data and some indicators that might be influence the child births:
                <ul>
                <li>child mortality (0-5 year olds dying per 1000 born)</li>
                <li>income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)</li>
                <li>women's education (average years spent in school by women aged between 15 and 44 years)</li>
                <li>urban population (% of total population living in urban areas)</li>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3"> The above left plot clearly shows the differences
            among the regions of the world. In the first half of the investigated
            time period the birth rates were similar and rather constant in all
            parts of the world. Only in Europe women gave birth to less children
            than in the rest of the world. With the beginning of the industrialisation
            in Europe, the fertilty rate drastically decreased further. As an
            interesting side fact, it seems that both the First and the Second
            World War affected birth rates in Europe.</p>
        <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3">Around 1910 the global birth rates started to diverge with the
            largest differences between about 1950 and 1980.</p>
        <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3">In most parts of the world except Europe the fertility rate shortly
            increased in the 1960ies and 1970ies and then clearly decreased to
            values similar to the European ones. In almost all parts of the world
            women on average have between 1 and 3 children nowadays. Only in Sub
            Saharan Africa 4-5 children are born on average.</p>
        <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3">The histogram shows that while in 1800
            the global fertility rate was slightly skewed to the left, in 2020
            the data is very much skewed to the right. Most women nowadays give
            birth to 1-2 children, while some have 4-5 and a few have up to 7
            children.</p>

        <h5 id="subtitle" class="ml-3">Child mortality</h5>
        <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3"> In the top left figure it can be
            seen that the correlation between child mortality and fertility rate
            has changed over time. While in 1800 it was low, it steadily
            increased and in 2020 was quite high and positive with 0.86. Thus,
            in countries with high child mortality, women nowadays generally have
            more children.</p>
        <h5 id="subtitle" class="ml-3">Income per person</h5>
        <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3">The top right figure shows that this
            indicator does not correlate very high with the fertility rate.
            However, there was a tendency for a negative correlation in 1910 and
            2020, meaning that women had more children in countries with lower
            income per person. It must be noted that the y-axis in the top right
            figure is logarithmic because of the large income differences among
            the world. A visual inspection of this scatter plot implies a non-linear
            correlation, which is not represented by the correlation coefficient
            shown in the legend of the figure.</p>
        <h5 id="subtitle" class="ml-3">Education</h5>
        <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3">It is very interesting and striking
            to see in the bottom left figure that the negative correlation between
            the number of years a woman spent in school and the number of children
            she had was almost constant and quite high between 1970 and 2009 on a
            global level. So, in countries where women had a shorter education
            they generally had more children.</p>
        <h5 id="subtitle" class="ml-3">Urbanity</h5>
        <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3">The bottom right figure shows that
            the correlation between the fertility rate and the percentage of
            people living in urban areas was quite constant in the past 50 years.
            The linear relationship is negatvie but not very strong, so there is
            a slight tendency for women to have more children in rural areas.</p>

    <h4 id="subtitle" class="ml-3 mt-3 mb-2">Conclusions</h4>
    <h5 id="subtitle" class="ml-3">Changes over time</h5>
    <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3"> The mean global fertility rate has
        changed considerably over the past 220 years, as it dropped from about 6
        to 2-3 children per woman between 1800 and 2020. However, the fertility
        was rather constant for about 100 years only started decreasing in the
        beginning of the 20th century. This was also the point in time when the
        fertility rate started to diverge among the regions of the world, with a
        maximum spread in the 1960ies and 1970ies. By 2020, the fertility rates
        of the world regions have converged again. Conducting an ANOVA could
        shed more light on the effect of the world region on the fertility rate.</p>
    <h5 id="subtitle" class="ml-3">Correlation with indicators</h5>
    <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3">The strongest correlation between the
        fertility rate and the investigated indicators was observed for education
        and child mortality:
        <ul>
            <li> Between 1960 and 2009 women with less education were more likely
                to have more children.</li>
            <li> While in 1800 there was no linear relationship between child
                mortality and the fertility rate, this correlation has increased
                with time. In 2020 women had more children in countries with higher
                child mortality.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3"> The income per person in a country is
        not linearly correlated with the fertility rate. However, the visualisations
        above imply a logarithmic relationship. This could be further investigated.</p>
    <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3"> The amount of people living in urban
        areas does not seem to be correlated with the fertility rate in a specific
        country and this is similar for the different world regions.</p>
    <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3"> With a linear regression, the effects
        of these indicators could be investigated more specifically.</p>
    <h5 id="subtitle" class="ml-3">Limitations</h5>
    <p id="intro" class="mt-3 ml-3 mr-3">This analysis only scrapes on the surface
        of what could be explored. As stated above, linear regression and ANOVA
        could clarify more clearly the influence of factors and variables.
        Furthermore, the data concerning female education and the urbanity level
        of a country are not available for very early and most recent years. At
        the same time, the relationship between female education and fertility
        rate was quite strong. It would be interesting to see if this is still
        the case nowadays and how the relationship was 200 years ago.</p>
